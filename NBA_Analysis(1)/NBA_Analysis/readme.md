# README
This folder is divided into three parts:

One is the season of the original dataset (22-23) and one is the season of the new dataset (23-24). Another is Data Mapping, which is a basic preprocessing of new data. **Data Sources** corresponding to the report.

In the folder of each season, there are two codes. The first file corresponds to the **4. NBA Player Rating System Research Report: From Unified Model to Position-Aware Optimization (Who is MVP)** and **6. Optimization of the scoring system - Introduction of location-aware mechanism.**  The second file corresponds to the reported **5.Clustering & Random forests analysis for player win-rate.**

Thanks for reading.
